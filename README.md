## 👋 Welcome there

<div align="center"width="100%">

I'm Jeanne, a **curious and adaptable** software engineer student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, especially for its technical challenges and logical problem-solving aspects.

I enjoy **investigating complex issues and collaborating with others**, as I did during **my 4 CTFs experiences, including one focused on OSINT**. These challenges allowed me to sharpen **both my investigative mindset and my ability to work effectively in a team**.

At 42, I had the opportunity to practice through hands-on projects. These experiences enabled me to apply various programming languages such as *C, C++, Typescript*, and **hone my approach to technical issues**. 

Today I am actively seeking for opportunities in **Forensics** to deepen my expertise and contribute to concrete projects.

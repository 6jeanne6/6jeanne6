## 👋 Welcome there

<div align="center"width="100%">

I'm Jeanne, a **curious and adaptable** software engineer student with a strong interest in full-stack development and cybersecurity.

I enjoy **investigating complex issues and collaborating with others**, as I did during **my 4 CTFs experiences, including one focused on OSINT**. These challenges allowed me to sharpen **both my investigative mindset and my ability to work effectively in a team**.

At 42, I gained **hands-on experience through concrete projects**, using languages such as *C, C++, and Typescript*. This school's ecosystem constantly **pushes you to learn, adapt and think rigorously - both independently and in collaboration with your peers**.

My latest **group project**, *ft_transcendence*, is a **full-stack web application** featuring multiple services, including a Pong game and a customizable user profile page. The **frontend** was developed in **vanilla TypeScript**, communicating with a **backend** built using **Fastify, Node.js, and SQLite**. **Rigor, patience, and communication were key to delivering a reliable and functional product.**

I have also worked as a **Project Manager**, coordinating between **different teams** and **managing priorities**.

I am actively seeking opportunities where I can deepen my technical skills and contribute to **meaningful, concrete projects** across **forensics** or **full-stack applications**.

✉ **You can reach me for further discussions:**  jewu@student.42.fr
